PROJECT OVERVIEW

*Motivation: The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual
sufferfrom the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop
serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional
staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides
this temporary staff.

*Objective: Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.

*Scope: The agency covers all hospitalsin each of the 50 states of the United States,
and the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.

HYPOTHESIS

Elderly people are most likely to be affected during the influenza season due to less
immunity power.

DATASETS USED

INFLUENZA DEATHS DATA

* SOURCE: CDC
* The data set contains the influenza deaths for each year from 2009 to 2017 for each
state in the US, the month in which the person dies and the age group of the person
who died.

POPULATION DATA

*SOURCE: Census
*The data set contains the population of the people in each state in the US, which
county they belong to, their age group and gender.

DATA LIMITATIONS

* For Influenza Deaths data set: For the number of deaths column some of the rows
were denoted as suppressed due to privacy reasons so I changed it to a random
number from 0-10 since all suppressed deaths can’t be 0 and the row can’t be
deleted for cleaning as it contains valuable information.
* For Population data set: The data set after cleaning doesn’t lack any information and
since it’s from a reputable source there is no possibility of bias in the data set. The
only drawback is the data is taken for every year unlike the influenza deaths data
taken every month so there is a possibility of slight inaccuracies after data
integration.

RESULTS AND INSIGHTS

NULL HYPOTHESIS

The chance of people dying due to influenza is equal or higher for people aged below 65 years
when compared to people aged above 65 years.

ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS

The chance of people dying due to influenza is lower for people aged below 65 years when
compared to people aged above 65 years which is the statement for my Hypothesis.

TYPE OF TEST

This is a one tailed test since from the hypothesis we require only the death rate of people aged
above 65 years.

SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL

α= 0.05

P-VALUE

The p-value is way lower than the significance level of 0.05 so we can reject the null hypothesis
and continue with further analysis for my research hypothesis.

NEXT STEPS FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS
*Find the states and county with the highest number of deaths for both people aged over
65 years and the entire age group so that the staffing agency can plan accordingly.
*Find if the population influences the percentage of death rate for vulnerable people
aged over 65 years.
*Communicate and share your findings with the stakeholders.
